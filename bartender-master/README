To use:

	- if you are using JQM, just add the class "apple-navbar-ui" to your navbar <ul> element, 
	- add a class of "comboSprite" (single retina-regular sprite) or "soloSprite" (separate sprites) to the <ul> element, 
	- change the data-icons and add your sprite URL path(s),
	- copy the CSS behind the JQM CSS and you are good to go
